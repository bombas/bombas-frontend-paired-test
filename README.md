# Bombas Frontend Paired Programming Exercise

Welcome to the Bombas Frontend Paired-Programming Exercise!

In this repo, you will find a simple, pre-built React application that your technical interviewer will walk through with you as well as provide you with the exercise criteria.

The paired programming session will focus on integrating an API data response into the pre-built front-end application and adding new components to a page using an existing design system.

The coding exercise leverages Node.js, React, Sass/CSS, and (foundational) Javascript (or Typescript). The design system that is used is [Elastic UI](https://eui.elastic.co/pr_3350/#/).

## How to run the app

```js
npm start

// or

yarn start
```
